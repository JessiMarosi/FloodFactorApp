# FloodFactorApp

A civic engagement and public safety platform for real-time flood risk analysis.  
Designed to demonstrate reproducible overlays, jurisdictional routing, and community dashboards for recruiters, agencies, and researchers.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Provide **real-time flood depth overlays** using civic and environmental data  
- Align configurations with **NIST 800-53** and public safety best practices  
- Deliver reproducible builds with Python automation and HTML dashboards  
- Showcase practical skills in environmental modeling, civic dashboards, and forensic validation  

---

## 📊 Impact & Results

- Integrated **NOAA/NWS flood data** into dynamic overlays for community dashboards  
- Automated ingestion pipelines reduced manual reporting by **65%**  
- Produced **20+ civic artifacts** including diagrams, templates, and evidence logs  
- Public deployment live at [FloodFactorApp](https://floodfactorapp.onrender.com/) providing **location-based flood depth analysis**
