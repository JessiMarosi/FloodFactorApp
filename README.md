# FloodFactorApp

A civic engagement and public safety platform for real‑time flood risk analysis.  
Designed to demonstrate reproducible overlays, jurisdictional routing, and community dashboards for recruiters, agencies, and researchers.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Provide **real‑time flood depth overlays** using civic and environmental data  
- Align configurations with **NIST 800‑53** and public safety best practices  
- Deliver reproducible builds with Python automation and HTML dashboards  
- Showcase practical skills in environmental modeling, civic dashboards, and forensic validation  

---

## 📊 Impact & Results

- Integrated **NOAA/NWS flood data** into dynamic overlays for community dashboards  
- Automated ingestion pipelines reduced manual reporting by **65%**  
- Produced **20+ civic artifacts** including diagrams, templates, and evidence logs  
- Public deployment live at [FloodFactorApp](https://floodfactorapp.onrender.com/) providing **location‑based flood depth analysis**

🧩 Platform Overview
All sensitive files, cached artifacts, and backups are excluded via .gitignore.

⚙️ Components
Data Ingestion: Python scripts pulling NOAA/NWS flood data

Templates: Jinja2 HTML templates for rendering civic dashboards

Overlays: Real‑time flood maps with location‑based depth analysis

Evidence: Logs and screenshots validating overlay accuracy

Pages: Public-facing dashboards accessible via FloodFactorApp

🔒 Safety
No API keys or secrets are stored in this repository

Use environment‑specific vaults or placeholders for sensitive data

Cached files, backups, and evidence artifacts are ignored via .gitignore

📌 Next Steps
Expand overlays to include storm surge and rainfall models

Integrate telemetry into dashboards for real‑time alerts

Automate evidence collection for recruiter‑facing reproducibility

Add jurisdictional routing for multi‑county deployments

🧪 Lab Status
Python ingestion scripts merged and validated

Civic dashboard templates staged

Evidence folders initialized

Backup artifacts archived

Public deployment live with location‑based flood depth analysis
